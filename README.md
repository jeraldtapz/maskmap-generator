## What is a mask map? 
### A mask map is a texture that has **Metallic, Ambient Occlusion, Detail, Smoothness** maps on the texture's R, G, B and A channel respectively.
### Unity's default Lit Shader for HDRP uses a mask map. This is done for optimization purposes.
### Creating a mask map is easy on any image-editing software, e.g. Photoshop. It's very time consuming, however, if you're creating mask maps for a lot of textures. 

## **Mask Map Generator**
### Mask Map Generator is a basic editor tool in Unity3D that let's you select a Metallic, AO, Detail and Smoothness map and create a mask map that has those textures on the proper channels.
